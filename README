NamespacedNestedResources
=========================

This plugin makes nesting resources for a namespace a little bit easier by allowing controllers to be organised into directories whilst keeping routes short and sweet.

Tested to work with rails 2.3

Example
=======

In a scenario where you have an admin section and you have the following:
- app/controllers/admin/categories_controller.rb
- app/controllers/admin/categories/products_controller.rb

If you wish to nest these two controllers in the routing you would need to explicitly set where they live. With the plugin you can short form the routings to look like:

map.namespace :admin do |admin|
  admin.resources :categories do |category|
    category.resources :products
  end
end

Without the plugin, the above route would error, as it would be looking for Admin::ProductsController rather than Admin::Categories::ProductsController
